# g4less // Grocery4Less

This is a grocery item finder that performs returns food items from various grocery stores so that the user can select the cheapest one and add it to their grocery list. As of right now, this project is only calling from the Wal-Mart API, but other big grocery chains are to come. 

This is written in Meteor/Blaze and implements OAUth 2.0 so that users can login through their Facebook or Instagram accounts.

Features to come: 
* Generate recipes based on user's grocery list.
* Allow users to create a group grocery list with other members
